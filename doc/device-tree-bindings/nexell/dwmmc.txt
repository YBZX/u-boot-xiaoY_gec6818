* Nexell DWC_mobile_storage

The Nexell provides DWC_mobile_storage interface which supports
. Embedded Multimedia Cards (EMMC-version 4.5)
. Secure Digital memory (SD mem-version 3.0)
. Secure Digital I/O (SDIO-version 3.0)

The Nexell DWC_mobile_storage provides 3 channels.
SOC specific and Board specific properties are channel specific.

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible: should be
	- nexel,exynos-dwmmc: for exynos platforms

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.
- index: physical chanell index.

Required Board Specific Properties:

- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.
- nexel,bus-width: The width of the bus used to interface the devices
	supported by DWC_mobile_storage (SD-MMC/EMMC/SDIO).
	. Typically the bus width is 4 or 8.
	. 8bit width support only ch2.
- nexell,drive_dly: Output drive clock delay. range is 0 ~ 255.
- nexell,drive_shift: Output drive clock phase shift. range is 0 ~ 3
- nexell,sample_dly: Read sample clock delay. range is 0 ~ 255.
- nexell,sample_shift: Read sample clock phase shitf. range is 0 ~ 255.
-frequency: sd,mmc clock frequency, typically 50MHz
- nexell,ddr: uset ddr transfer mode, support only ch2, 8bit bus width.
Example:

mmc0:mmc@c0062000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "nexell,nexell-dwmmc";
	reg = <0xc0062000 0x1000>;
	nexell,bus-width = <4>;
	index = <0>;
	status = "disabled";
};


mmc0:mmc@c0062000 {
	frequency = <50000000>;
	nexell,drive_dly = <0x0>;
	exell,drive_shift = <0x03>;
	nexell,sample_dly = <0x00>;
	nexell,sample_shift = <0x02>;
	status = "okay";
};
