NEXELL, NXE2000 pmic

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/nxe2000.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/nxe2000.c (for child regulators)

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver.

To bind the regulators, please read the additional binding info:
- doc/device-tree-bindings/regulator/nxe2000.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: "nexell,nxe2000"
- reg = 0x34

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- voltage-regulators: subnode list of each device's regulator
  (see nxe2000.txt - regulator binding info)

Example:

	nxe2000 {
		compatible = "nexell,nxe2000";

		voltage-regulators {
			dcdc1: BUCK1 {
				...
			};
			...
			ldo1: LDO1 {
				...
			};
			...
		};
	};
