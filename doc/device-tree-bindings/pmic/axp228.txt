X-Powers, AXP228 pmic

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/axp228.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/axp228.c (for child regulators)

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver.

To bind the regulators, please read the additional binding info:
- doc/device-tree-bindings/regulator/axp228.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: "x-powers,axp228"
- reg = 0x34

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- voltage-regulators: subnode list of each device's regulator
  (see axp228.txt - regulator binding info)

Example:

	axp228 {
		compatible = "x-powers,axp228";

		voltage-regulators {
			dcdc1: BUCK1 {
				...
			};
			...
			ldo1: LDO1 {
				...
			};
			...
		};
	};
