X-Powers, AXP228 regulators

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/axp228.c (as parent I/O device)
- drivers/power/regulator/axp228.c (for child regulators)

This file describes the binding info for the REGULATOR driver.

First, please read the binding info for the pmic:
- doc/device-tree-bindings/pmic/axp228.txt

Required subnode:
- voltage-regulators: required for the PMIC driver

Required properties:
- regulator-name: used for regulator uclass platform data '.name'

Optional:
- regulator-min-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-max-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-always-on: regulator should be never disabled
- regulator-boot-on: regulator should be enabled by the bootloader

Example:
(subnode of axp228 pmic node)
	voltage-regulators {
		dcdc1: BUCK1 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3400000>;
			regulator-name = "dcdc1";
		};
		.
		.
		.
		dcdc5: BUCK5 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <2550000>;
			regulator-name = "dcdc5";
		};

		aldo1: LDO1 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-name = "aldo1";
		};
		.
		.
		.
		dc5ldo: LDO11 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
			regulator-name = "dc5ldo";
		};
	};
