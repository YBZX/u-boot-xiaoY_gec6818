NEXELL, NXE2000 regulators

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/nxe2000.c (as parent I/O device)
- drivers/power/regulator/nxe2000.c (for child regulators)

This file describes the binding info for the REGULATOR driver.

First, please read the binding info for the pmic:
- doc/device-tree-bindings/pmic/nxe2000.txt

Required subnode:
- voltage-regulators: required for the PMIC driver

Required properties:
- regulator-name: used for regulator uclass platform data '.name'

Optional:
- regulator-min-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-max-microvolt: minimum allowed Voltage to set
- regulator-always-on: regulator should be never disabled
- regulator-boot-on: regulator should be enabled by the bootloader

Example:
(subnode of nxe2000 pmic node)
	voltage-regulators {
		dcdc1: BUCK1 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3500000>;
			regulator-name = "dcdc1";
		};
		.
		.
		.
		dcdc5: BUCK5 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3500000>;
			regulator-name = "dcdc5";
		};

		ldo1: LDO1 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3500000>;
			regulator-name = "ldo1";
		};
		.
		.
		.
		ldortc2: LDO12 {
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1700000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3500000>;
			regulator-name = "ldortc2";
		};
	};
